      <h2 id="aboutmetitle">About the Author</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm @LLL2024, Jessica Lin, a media student who is passionate about image creation and storytelling. My creations often explore the relationship between technology and emotion, memory and the senses, with a particular focus on the ethical and emotional impacts that future technology may bring.„ÄÇ</p>
    <p>In my daily life, I enjoy taking photos, traveling and documenting details. I also turn some inspirations into such semi-fictional and semi-real stories. For me, creation is not merely about expression; it is also a way to share curiosity and thoughts with readers.</p>

      <h2 id="aboutsentititle">About SentiSnap</h2>
     <p>SentiSnap was released in 2031, making photos no longer just "visible", but "audible". It combines the release of real olfactory molecules with a neural olfactory synchronization algorithm, which can evoke the odor memory of the moment you took the photo when you view it.</p>

    <p>Everyone, you have NO idea how crazy this thing is. SentiSnap, the app that lets you make actual photos with smell is insane. It has become as ordinary as checking the weather or snapping a selfie ever since its release in 2031. Just click a photo and you will be right back there in your memory! The creamy scent of my birthday cake, the salt of heartbreak tears, or the warm wind mixed with hot dog grease on a random overpass evening. Most people use it daily, but I rarely did.</p>
    <p>It's not that I reject it or am afraid of any technology, it's just that I have no interest in driving it at all. Smelling memories is just too straightforward for me. But things completely changed last winter, when I worked overtime until midnight. I was numb from the cold and the tea was cold, even losing its flavor. Out of boredom, I casually browsed through the old folders on my computer. By accident, I came across a photo with the suffix ".senti "- DSC_Kitchen198.senti.</p>

    <p>I froze completely! That was a photo of me when I was seven years old, when SentiSnap was just released. My brother was simply crazy. He installed the software right away and excitedly told me as if he had won a big prize, "It can take pictures of smell!" .</p>

    <p>I was sitting at the dining table that afternoon. Behind me, mum was busy in front of the stove, wearing that pink apron. The countertop was in a complete mess. On the cutting board, there were green onion all over the place, garlic skins stuck to the edges, and a pot of meat sizzling. My brother held up that camera and captured this scene on the stove.</p>
    <p>Twenty years later, I clicked on that file. SentiSnap buzzed off, releasing flavor molecules and activating the switch deep in my brain. The next second, I was thrown back into that kitchen. First, the aroma of rice wafted towards you, then the warm scent of the soup pot, and then, oh god, the refreshing scent of lemon dishwashing liquid. There was also the metallic smell of the gas stove, a small scorched spot on my mum's apron, and the old wooden smell of the wooden chair. I'm no longer on the sofa. I've become the seven-year-old me again, my feet swaying under the chair. Mum said, "Hurry up and wash your hands. It's time for dinner."</p>
    <p>I didn't cry when I saw the photo. I just sat there, sipping that bowl of air mouthful by mouthful as if it were soup. Then I started looking through other photos: the barbecue by the roadside during the Christmas celebration, the warm taste of cooking at home with friends, the damp air on a rainy day on the street, the fragrance of roses my first boyfriend gave me...</p>

    <p>To be honest, later on I gradually found that this thing was becoming less and less "personal". The new version of SentiSnap is simply terrifying. It can amplify the flavor to a perverted level - you're nervous, you just cried, you're lying, none of it can be concealed. Nowadays, there are even companies selling so-called "emotion masking sprays", claiming that they can cover up the "molecules that leak emotions" on your body. It's just like you have to spray perfume to protect yourself.</p>
    <p>The film industry has also gone bad. Nowadays, many news reports say that many movies have added the SentiSnap interactive plug-in, allowing viewers to smell the flavor of the story.</p>
    <p>The most terrifying thing is this! One day, I passed by the subway station. There was a perfume advertisement on the screen. In the picture, a woman was cooking in the kitchen. Guess what? Oh my goodness! It's almost exactly the same as the kitchen in my childhood. The subtitle says: "Do you still remember the taste when she cooked?" The next second, the fragrance spray at the subway entrance was activated. That's right! That was the smell of the kitchen! The warm aroma of the rice, the salty and fragrant taste of the soy sauce, the lemon-flavored detergent, and the scent of my mum! Almost exactly the same! The advertisement continues: "Every flavor comes from true memories." To be honest, I  freaked out.</p>

  <div class="content-box">
    <p>I began to wonder how many people's memories are still being filled into scent bottles, hung in the air conditioners of shopping malls, and turned into click-through rates of advertisements? We think we are preserving memories, but in fact, we are uploading them.</p>
    <p>I didn't delete the photo, nor did I uninstall this software, but I never touched it again because just thinking about it makes me want to smash my computer! I want to keep my childhood's scent, but now it might have been diluted into the noses of millions of people. I want to protect my past, but it's very likely that it has already turned into data and mixed into some company's crappy new product.</p>
    <p>This is probably the most insane romance of this era. You can "save" your memory or sell it. So I began to think: When memory is no longer your exclusive possession but becomes the air that others can casually take a breath of - is it still called your memory? Or is it just another bottle of goods in their inventory? I don't know. I'm scared.</p>
